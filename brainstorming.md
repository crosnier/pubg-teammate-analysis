# Brainstorming

Ideas for advanced insights and summaries that may provide a competitive edge or uncover unusual patterns.

⸻

🔥 Performance Efficiency Metrics
	•	Kill Efficiency = Total Kills ÷ Rounds Played (per mode)
	•	K/D Ratio = Kills ÷ (Losses + Suicides)
	•	Assist Ratio = Assists ÷ Kills (to spot team-focused players)
	•	DBNO Conversion = Knockdowns that became kills (indicates finishing ability)

⸻

🧠 Behavioral Tendencies
	•	Aggression Index = (Kills + Headshots + Longest Kill Shot) ÷ Time Survived
Helps spot when you’re playing aggressive vs. passive.
	•	Team Risk Index = (Team Kills + Suicides) ÷ Rounds Played
Useful for identifying if you’re hurting squad chances.
	•	Loot Efficiency = Weapons Acquired ÷ Kills
Higher numbers may suggest overlooting or not converting gear into results.

⸻

🛠 Support Role Scoring
	•	Weighted score using: Revives, Heals, Boosts
e.g. (Revives × 3) + (Heals × 1) + (Boosts × 0.5)
Use this to compare your own support value vs. other teammates.

⸻

🚗 Mobility Impact
	- Distance per Round = Total Walked/Driven ÷ Rounds
    	- Compare this to teammates to infer playstyle (sniper vs. looter vs. fragger)
	•	Road Kill Ratio = Road Kills ÷ Driven Distance
		Rare metric — high numbers may indicate an unorthodox but effective player.

⸻

🏆 Clutch Rating
	•	Combine:
	•	Round Most Kills
	•	Kill Streak Max
	•	Longest Kill Shot
	•	Wins ÷ Top 10 Finishes (clutch conversion)

This reveals which players thrive in endgame or solo-clutch situations.

📊 Telemetry-Based Insights

If you parse telemetry:
	•	Bot Identification: Bots usually:
		•	Have generic or odd usernames
		•	Don’t perform knockdowns
		•	Move inefficiently
		•	Always miss grenades
		•	You could flag them automatically and track your bot-to-human kill ratio
	•	First 3-Min Stats:
		•	Distance moved
		•	Items picked up
		•	Engagements started
These help reveal early game tempo and drop effectiveness.

⸻

🧩 Similarity Scores

Cross-reference teammates you’ve played with most:
	•	Common match count
	•	Win rate when teamed with X
	•	Average kill diff vs. baseline when teamed with X

Could be visualized as:

“You’re 40% more likely to survive Top 10 when teamed with JdogFPS”
